            <p className='h2p1'>
            My name is Samantha Morgan, and I have been a fine artist since my youth. I find inspiration from the innovative styles of contemporary and urban art, such as graphic and graffiti illustrations.
            </p>
            <p className='h2p2'>
            I strongly believe that art is a global form of communication. It educates visually by either moving you, pleasing you, or even inspiring you. It has so much effect on oneâ€™s emotion, more than a person can affect another by words or action. besides painting, I also share my skills and knowledge with beginner artists during my annual painting courses.
